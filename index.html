# Hello fellow human!

I am assuming you are here because you want to know more about me, or want a quick pointer to my [resume]. Maybe you are [someone] who knows me quite well, or just some random scraper, which somehow landed here. Regardless of your purpose, I would like thank you for donating one more hit to my page views, as I [smirk] my way, behind the retina display, to feeling more *significant* than I felt yesterday.
<br>

|TL;DR||

    You are procrastinating.

### tiny_little_story 
`Stay Tuned`
### recent
There are some platforms I religiously follow to stay updated with what is trending in fields of my interest. This is a continously updated list of everything that I find fascinating. `last update: 21st April'17`

#####  top_5_AI_hunts
* [VoiceOps] - AI powered call analytics for sales
* [Mark] - Create flowcharts & diagrams in seconds powered by AI
* [FriendlyData] - Communicate with databases like a human
* [AutoCorrect] - Autocorrect for drawing, by Google

### recommend
These are some gems on the interent that I specially love. Again, continously updated. `last update: 21st April'17`

* [Nerdwriter] - This *youtube* channel covers a wide variety of topics from philosophy to science, and anything and everything in between. Evan Puschak, is by far the best content creator I have come across on Youtube. His keen eye towards understanding why and how a movie is the way it is, to disecting how trump answers a question, is, for a lack of a better word, mind-blowing. And, I really wonder what is more satisfying than a coherent, unique perspective.

* [The Twenty-Minute VC] - A *podcast* started by a young, passionate harry stebbings, is one of the best weekly-updated repository of all the insights you need in the venture world, right from the nerves of world's smartest venture partners. Start digging in. Now.

* [Hacker Newsletter] - This simple yet extremely useful *newsletter*, parses through everything trending on Hacker News for the week, divides them into categories and drops you a nicely curated weekly mail. A good hack to avoid hacker news lurking.

### ideas
Online or offline, whenever there comes an idea that hits me well, I try to internalize it. This is a concious attempt at documenting and sharing those concepts.

> The reality is if you walk down the street and there are a thousand people in the street, I think all thousand are talking to themselves in their head at any given point. They're constantly judging everything that they see. They're playing back movies of things that happened to them yesterday. They're living in fantasy worlds of what's going to happen tomorrow. They're just pulled out of base reality.
> That could be good when you're doing long-range planning. It can be good
when you're solving problems. It's good for the survival and replication
machines that we are. I think it's actually very bad for your happiness. In
my mind, the mind should be a servant and a tool, not a master. It's not
something that should be controlling me and driving me 24/7.
> ~ Naval Ravikant @ [Farnam Street]

### art
I usually capture still videos, of a minute or two, of all the places I visit. Hoping, that one day, I will create a good movie out of it. But before that day comes, here's me open-sourcing some of that footage under the MIT License.

- [Kodaikanal], Tamil Nadu, India
- [Brooklyn Bridge Park], New York, USA
- [Vue Lounge], New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA


Thanks for sticking through. I'd love to know you as well. [Write] to me, and I swear, I will be as curious as I am below.

   [All my notes]: <www.CourseNotes.com>
   [I was born in a very small village in Bantwa, which is on the west coast of India. However, I have entirely been raised in a two-tier city called Vadodara, which is mostly famous for a historic palace and a massive garden in the middle of the city. My parents, inspite of being from a rural background, are educated, and subsequently, have a large bandwidth to accepting new ideas everyday. They encourage learning in all its shape and form. And that is also the reason, why I believe I have had a very privileged life so far. From studying in one of the best schools in town, to also allowing me to pursue my bachelors, 8800 miles away from home, I salute them for their courage.]: <www.comingsoon.com>
