## tiny_little_story‚Äå‚Äå ‚Äå‚Äå  üìù
I should be writing a little story about my background, except I procrastinate a lot when it comes to writing. `Stay Tuned`

<br>

## recommend‚Äå‚Äå ‚Äå‚Äå  üíØ
Here's everything that I'm really glad to have recently come across in my little bubble.

## favourites‚Äå‚Äå ‚Äå‚Äå  üòç
These are some gems on the internet that I've learnt a lot from. They could always use more love.

* [Nerdwriter] - This *youtube* channel covers a wide variety of topics from philosophy to science, and anything and everything in between. Evan Puschak, is by far the best content creator I have come across on Youtube. His keen eye towards understanding why and how a movie is the way it is, to dissecting how trump answers a question, is, for a lack of a better word, mind-blowing. And, I really wonder what is more satisfying than a coherent, unique perspective.

* [The Twenty-Minute VC] - A *podcast* started by a young, passionate harry stebbings, is one of the best weekly-updated repository of all the insights you need in the venture world, right from the nerves of world's smartest venture partners. Start digging in. Now.

* [Hacker Newsletter] - This simple yet extremely useful *newsletter*, parses through everything trending on Hacker News for the week, divides them into categories and drops in your inbox a nicely curated weekly mail. A good hack to avoid hacker news lurking.

## ideas ‚Äå‚Äå  üí°
Online or offline, whenever there comes an idea that hits me well, I try to internalize it. This is a conscious attempt at documenting and sharing those concepts.

> The reality is if you walk down the street and there are a thousand people in the street, I think all thousand are talking to themselves in their head at any given point. They're constantly judging everything that they see. They're playing back movies of things that happened to them yesterday. They're living in fantasy worlds of what's going to happen tomorrow. They're just pulled out of base reality.
> That could be good when you're doing long-range planning. It can be good
when you're solving problems. It's good for the survival and replication
machines that we are. I think it's actually very bad for your happiness. In
my mind, the mind should be a servant and a tool, not a master. It's not
something that should be controlling me and driving me 24/7.
> ~ Naval Ravikant @ [Farnam Street]

## art ‚Äå‚Äå  üé•
I usually capture still videos, of a minute or two, of all the places I visit. Hoping that one day, I will create a montage out of it.

- [Kodaikanal], Tamil Nadu, India
- [Allepey Backwaters], Kerala, India
- [Vue Lounge], New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA

Thanks for sticking through. If you want to dwell over half baked ideas or futile philosophy, [Tweet] to me, and I swear, I will send a raven back.

   [All my notes]: <www.CourseNotes.com>
   [I was born in a very small village in Bantwa, which is on the west coast of India. However, I have entirely been raised in a two-tier city called Vadodara, which is mostly famous for a historic palace and a massive garden in the middle of the city. My parents, inspite of being from a rural background, are educated, and subsequently, have a large bandwidth to accepting new ideas everyday. They encourage learning in all its shape and form. And that is also the reason, why I believe I have had a very privileged life so far. From studying in one of the best schools in town, to also allowing me to pursue my bachelors, 8800 miles away from home, I salute them for their courage.]: <www.comingsoon.com>
